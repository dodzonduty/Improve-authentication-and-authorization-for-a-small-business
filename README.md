# Improve-authentication-and-authorization-for-a-small-business
<h1> Description</h1>
I was the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.
Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked me to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

To do this, I’ll need to do some investigations on the incident to better understand what happened. First, I reviewed the <a href="Accounting Logs .pdf">accounting logs</a> of the incident. Next, I took notes that helped me identify a possible threat actor. Then, I spotted issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. After that, I recommended mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.Finally,It was time to write a <a href="Access control report.pdf"> report</a> to summarize all of this to the stakeholders.
